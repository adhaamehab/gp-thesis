Despite recent advances in natural language processing, the main focus of the progress was on the English language. And while Arabic is a critically important area of natural language processing and natural language understanding. The NLP ecosystem still missing an industrial-strength tool to build an arabic-lang natural language processing. We introduce the first version of a complete natural language processing system that takes raw text as input, and performs tasks ranging from tokenization and sentence segmentation, to POS-tagging.

We chooses to package this system as an extension to TextBlob; A well-know industrial-ready python package that supports adding independent languages extensions as a standalone projects and connect  them via a specific interface. Which allows a multi-lingual processing.
